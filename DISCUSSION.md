### LeAlan Carter - Take  Home

#### General Notes
 - The backend portions are definitely my weakest areas, but where I spent most of my time. I spent some time before alotting my 2 hours just to get comfortable with Drizzle and refresh my SQL stuff in general, but I still got stuck a bit on searching through the JSON B Column. I didn't think there would be errors in the migrations or seeding, but the data was dirty for the payload column and it took me a bit to figure that out.

#### Things I wish I had more time for:
- Pagination or Load on Scroll for much larger data sets.
- Filters for the Specialties instead of searching over them, I think that would have enhanced performance and been a better UX,
- Adding Integration and Unit testing
- Some cooler styling, would liked to have added more colors and better styles, but I still think the cards are an overall improvement on the Table for UX.
